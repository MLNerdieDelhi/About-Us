# Welcome to MLNerdie!
Making Machine Learning Research Accessible to Everyone.

# About
MLNerdie is an open organization working towards the goal of making machine learning accessible to everyone as well as promote the research culture within the field of artificial intelligence. MLNerdie started out as an independent newsletter in November 2017 to explain machine learning publications in simpler words to the non-academic crowd. In 2018-mid 2019, we decided to expand to webinars, teaching machine learning from scratch and taking beginners step by step towards machine learning. Now, MLNerdie has become a cultural movement propagated around the world by some incredibly dedicated machine learning researchers who believe in making machine learning research more accessible to everyone. As such, they conduct local events, hackathons and conferences to propagate a rigorous research culture.

# Mission
At MLNerdie, we hope to build a strong distillable machine learning culture promoting interdisciplinary collaboration. One of our core goals at MLNerdie is to provide a platform to early career researchers and academics to talk about their research to a wider audience and invite industry collaborations for the same.
